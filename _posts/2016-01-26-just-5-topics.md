I am getting back into blogging after a hiatus of 6 years. My old gaming blog, [BioFission](http://biofission.blogspot.co.uk/) is amazingly still alive on Blogspot! For 2016, I plan to write 5 blog posts on topics that I have thought a lot about over the years. The ideas outlined here have significantly shaped my worldview and form the underlying motivation behind my every single action. I hope that you will enjoy it.

## 1. Evolution, human behavioral patterns and the next step in natural selection

* Evolution has its basis in natural selection, here is a classic example. Zebras are trying to outrun a lion, but zebras aren't faster than lions are they? Well, they don't have to be faster than lions to survive. **All they have to do is to be faster than the slowest zebra.**

* **Why do people like beautiful people?** Why is it that people treat beautiful people better than others? Some people say that it is from our evolutionary roots whereby good looks are a sign of health, such as how big hips signify great ability to carry a baby ( lower probability to suffer from miscarriage ). This however is increasingly less relevant with the advent of modern medicine. Another reason is that we know that good looking people are more likely to receive more attention / better treatment from the general populace thus it is evolutionary more favorable to marry good looking people due to these benefits, given that all things are equal.

* **One constant of evolution is change.** For the fundamental tenet of evolution is simply to survive. Whoever possesses the characteristics which promote survival in the current environment is more likely to procreate and thus pass that particular variant of the gene to the next generation. In the future, I see evolution not as something that gradually happens naturally over the year but rather a self-driven evolution using technology and human augmentation. 

* The evolutionary ideal for humanity would be twofold, the first would be to **conquer the stars** and spread ourselves over multiple planets to reduce the risk of extinction given an unexpected event ( Meteor strike, the Sun dies an early death etc ). The second would be to **conquer mortality**, either by modification of the human genetic code ( lengthening telomeres, overcoming the Hayflick Limit etc ). If humanity is capable of achieving this within the next 100 years or so, fun times would begin :)

## 2. The relationship between human progress and technology

Throughout history, technology has played a central role in shaping historical events, I'll outline a few examples below :

* Empires, warfare and colonies. Why is it that empires often control and subdued the local populace with so little manpower? 

**Answer: They have guns, local populace have knifes. They shoot, local populace dies. Easy!**

* US vs Japan in WWII. Same idea as above, nuke twice - tens of thousands dead with manufacturing capabilities highly impaired, Japan surrenders

* It's not just warfare. Think agriculture technology ( and thus being able to feed an increasingly large population ), advancement in medicine technology ( and thus humans live longer lives and contribute more to society and human wellbeing ), the Internet ( global communications and collaborations ). Technology has an incredibly intimate relationship with human progress, more needs to be done to promote and facilitate global technological growth and advancement. 


## 3. Inequality, Nature vs Nurture and Luck

* How much of nature and nurture do we actually control?

* We have no hand in deciding who our parents are, the genes we have and the initial environment that we are born into ( country of origin, the school you go to as a kid, the people you meet )

* If the premise above is true, and that these initial conditions will shape us immensely both in terms of physical conditioning and mental aptitude

* Is free will even a thing given all the above? You have zero control over the initial conditions of your birth AND the environment that immediately follows it. These things shape your ideas and how you think about thinks. Everything from that point forth will be influenced by what came before it.

* This brings me to my final point, luck. We often consider luck as chance, seems like a  stupidly obvious definition but how about this definition instead - "Luck is the probability of an event will occur". This has very strong implications, firstly - this implies that almost every event by extension can be considered "luck". "It was fortunate that she could make it to the hospital in time" , "It was fortunate that her necklace stopped the bullet from penetrating her heart", "Indeed, it was fortunate that you dated this rich man who gave you a sufficiently large necklace with a huge ass pendant on it because anything else probably wouldn't work" and so on...

* If we agree that the world is simply the interaction between numerous events such that each had a probability of occuring, anyone who has the exact probabilistic data on every single event in the Universe can predict anything with probabilitic accuracy.

## 4. Automation, Jobs and Welfare

## 5. TBD ( Religion potentially? )

No clue what this will be. 11 months to figure it out!


The date is 26th of January, 2016. I am currently 21 years old. We shall see how much I have accomplished by the end of the year :)
