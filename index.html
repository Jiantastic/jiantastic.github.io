    <p>Software engineer by trade, have worked in a wide variety of different industries such as travel, consulting and finance. I have worked with all sorts of technology across the entire spectrum(list to follow). Do enjoy breaking down immensely complex problems into simple tasks understood by a 5 year old. I derive great pleasure in developing user and business focused software solutions with automation being one of my specialties. In a state of permanent hunger for more data to feed my brain. Occassionally have streaks of pure adrenaline that fuels my creativity. My CV will eventually make its way here. Reserving my domain name so domain squatters can't rip me off later. Will probably blog some thoughts to serve as the front page of the man known as Wei Jian Wong. In the age of information, it is important to have technically literate yet business savvy individuals in your organization. Please contact me on LinkedIn or Twitter if you have a business problem that you think technology could solve :) </p>

    <h2>Some random thoughts, ramblings and brain dump I intend to turn into a blog post some day</h2>
    <p>Human societies and debt</p>

    <p>Inequality, Nature vs Nurture and Luck</p>
    <p>Automation, Jobs and Welfare</p>
    <p>The game that is life and how I intend to play it</p>
    <p>My first attempt at a <a href="https://youtu.be/AG-PP0yDvFE">Youtube video</a> for a university project on FPGAs, apologies for the bad audio</p>

    <h2>Presentations</h2>

    <p>A list of talks on a variety of topics which I find interesting. What I find useful when thinking about new ideas is the ability to hold an idea in your head without explicitly rejecting nor accepting it at face value, but to have the ability to draw upon these various competing ideas in a specific domain(such as luck) when faced with a data point in real life and cross compare the results of these ideas to develop a balanced model on how you can view the world. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Frank Abagnale: "Catch Me If You Can" | Talks at Google</h3>
    <p>A really interesting insight into the life of Frank Abagnale, as made famous by the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Catch Me If You Can</a>. He talks about how easy it is to commit fraud on planet Earth by virtue of social engineering, his life at the FBI and many interesting little snippets of knowledge :)</p>
