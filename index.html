    <p>Software engineer by trade, have worked in a wide variety of different industries such as travel, consulting and finance. I have worked with all sorts of technology across the entire spectrum(list to follow). Do enjoy breaking down immensely complex problems into simple tasks understood by a 5 year old. I derive great pleasure in developing user and business focused software solutions with automation being one of my specialties. In a state of permanent hunger for more data to feed my brain :). My CV will eventually make its way here. Reserving my domain name so domain squatters can't rip me off later. Will probably blog some thoughts to serve as the front page of the man known as Wei Jian Wong. In the age of information, it is important to have technically literate yet business savvy individuals in your organization. Please contact me on LinkedIn or Twitter if you have a business problem that you think technology could solve :) </p>
